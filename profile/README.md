## Hi there 👋

# Iridyne

**Multimodal AI Research & Quantitative Engineering**

Iridyne is a technical collective dedicated to bridging the gap between clinical medical imaging and systematic financial markets through high-performance computing and state-of-the-art machine learning architectures.

## 🔬 Core Research Fields

### 1. Medical AI Frameworks

We develop specialized diagnostic architectures that leverage multimodal data fusion. Our primary focus is the integration of structured clinical data with high-fidelity imaging to improve predictive accuracy in medical environments.

* **Multimodal Fusion**: Combining MLP-based tabular feature extraction with CNN-based (MobileNetV2) image processing.
* **Statistical Validation**: Implementing rigorous performance metrics including DeLong’s Test for AUC comparison and ROC curve analysis.

### 2. Quantitative Trading Systems

Systematic strategy development for the Web3 and Digital Asset ecosystem, focusing on robust backtesting and high-frequency execution logic.

* **Strategy Engineering**: Development of volatility-based models such as the `KeltnerRSBreakoutStrategy`.
* **Backtesting Infrastructure**: Multi-year, high-granularity analysis across major assets (BTC, ETH, SOL) with a focus on risk-adjusted returns and market regime adaptation.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Languages**: Python (Primary), Rust, Typst, Shell (Fish).
* **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, MobileNetV2, Multimodal Fusion Architectures.
* **Development Tools**: `uv` (Package Management), Docker, AI-Assisted Coding (Claude Code/OpenCode).
* **Operating Environments**: CachyOS, Debian.


## 📜 Methodology

Our engineering philosophy is built on three pillars:

1. **Mathematical Rigor**: Every AI model and trading strategy must pass exhaustive statistical validation before deployment.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Utilizing rolling-release kernels and optimized toolchains to ensure maximum computational throughput.
3. **Minimalist Implementation**: Reducing complexity in the codebase to ensure maintainability and rapid iteration.


## 📬 Contact & Collaboration

Iridyne is actively exploring the intersection of **Web3 / Solana Ecosystem** and **Advanced AI Testing Frameworks**.
